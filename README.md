## What is PicMarkr?

PicMarkr is a minimal, open source batch image watermarking tool for the web.
Easily overlay your organization's logo, a watermark, or a gradient on multiple images at once.
**No install, no upload, no data leaves your computer.**
Perfect for social media teams, creators, or anyone who needs fast, privacy-first batch logo overlays!

## Features

- **Batch Processing:** Upload and edit multiple images at once
- **Flexible Cropping:** Fit images to preconfigured size (by default 1080×1350) or keep original size
- **Logo Overlay:** Add your own PNG or SVG logo in any corner
- **Gradient Layer:** Optional fade-to-transparent overlay for better logo readability
- **Drag-to-Crop:** Precisely adjust image positioning in the crop frame
- **Live Preview:** See exactly what you will get before exporting
- **Export Options:** Download images as PNGs or all at once as a ZIP file
- **Privacy by Design:** All processing happens in your browser — images never leave your device

## Running Locally

To use all features (especially **downloading images from the canvas**), you must run PicMarkr from a local server.

> **Why?**
> Most browsers (including Chrome and Firefox) restrict saving files generated from a canvas when running directly from `file://` for security reasons. Running a local server avoids this issue.

### How to Run a Simple Local Server

You do not need anything fancy — just Python (preinstalled on most systems):

**For Python 3:**

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to:
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

You can now use all features of PicMarkr, including ZIP and image downloads!

## Usage

- **Upload Image(s):** Click "Upload Image(s)" and select one or more files
- **Adjust Settings:**
  - "Keep original size" or fit to preconfigured size
  - "Add gradient layer" (optional)
  - Logo corner position (top/bottom, left/right)
- **Drag Image** in the preview panel to adjust crop
- **Preview:** Use the arrow buttons to switch between images
- **Download:** Click "Download Image(s)" to save a single image or a ZIP with all processed files

## Why PicMarkr?

- **No installation** needed
- Works **100% offline**
- **Open source** and auditable
- **Does not upload or track** your images
- **Clean UI**, simple workflow

## Development

- **Built with:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Dependencies:**
  - [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) – for ZIP file creation
  - [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) – for cross-browser file downloads

## Logo

Default logo is in `logo.svg` — you are encouraged to swap in your own!

## Troubleshooting

- **If "Download" does not work:**
  Make sure you opened PicMarkr through `http://localhost:8000` (or your chosen local server), not as a `file://` path.
- **Why?**
  This is a security feature in all major browsers.
